This is just a starter template when starting with Rust Projects thru docker, this is based from https://hub.docker.com/_/rust, though might as well help you guys out there to start learning Rust with less installations.

## Installation

- Clone this or download
- In your terminal, run `./make.sh`
- Once installation has been made
  - Execute this command `./run.sh`
  - It should print out the **Hello, world!**
